# "Rick and Morty" Project in Vue

This project was created following the Vue course taught by [Carlos CÃ³rdova](https://www.udemy.com/user/carloscdev/) on Udemy. The course focuses on Vue 3, the Composition API, Vuex, and consuming a REST API to create a web application based on the animated series called "Rick and Morty."

## Udemy Course

If you're interested in learning Vue and how to build this application, I recommend taking the original course on Udemy: [Vue 3 and Composition API Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/vue-3-composition-api-vuex-api-rest-rick-and-morty/).

## Project Description

This project is a web application that utilizes the Vue Composition API to interact with the "Rick and Morty" REST API. You can explore information about the characters, episodes, and locations from the series.

## How to Test the Project

If you're a new user and want to test the project in your local environment, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system. If you don't have it, you can download it from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RickC1218/rick-and-morty-vue.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd rick-and-morty-vue
npm install
```

### Start the Development Server

Once all dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with the following command:

```bash
npm run serve
```

This will start the development server and provide you with a local URL where you can access the application in your browser.

```plaintext
App running at:
- Local:   http://localhost:8080/
```

Now, you should be able to access the "Rick and Morty" application in your local browser and explore it!
